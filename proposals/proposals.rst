Proposals and Application Specific Extensions
=============================================

Proposals to enhance OpenRaster should be created as merge requests to the specification. Submitters should fork the openraster specification in order to create a proposal.

Proposals should contain:

 * Summary of the proposed feature
 * Discuss why the feature is useful for an interchange format
 * An actual patch to the specification
 * A link to at least one sample implementation

Proposals should be announced on the create@lists.freedesktop.org mailing list, but discussions should happen on the merge request.

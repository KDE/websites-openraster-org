Welcome to OpenRaster.org
=========================

This is the home of the Open Raster spec, version |version|.

OpenRaster is file format specification for the exchange of layered raster images 
between image editors. OpenRaster was `proposed in 2006 by Boudewijn Rempt and
Cyrille Berger <https://valdyas.org/fading/software/openraster/>`__. 

OpenRaster is an intentionally simple file format, similar to the Open Document
file format: a zip file with an xml document describing the layer structure and a 
png image for each raster layer or an svg image for each vector layer.

Applications that support OpenRaster are Krita, GIMP, MyPaint and Scribus.
